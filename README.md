# Wine Quality Project
Physiochemical Properties and Quality of Wine

**Objective:**
We are trying to determine which physicochemical properties of wine have the most impact on quality. The physiochemical properties in our data set are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.


**Files:**
For this project we will use two datasets which total 6499 records, which represent a wine and their properties and their qualities. 

-winequality-white.csv 
-winequality-red.csv  

You can also find the files here. 

**Tools used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, statsmodels

**Exploratory Analysis:**


**Instructions**
Please perform the following tasks in Python using the 2 datasets available from the GitHub repo or _.

1. Open and read the csv files using pandas. The data did not need any cleaning because it did not contain any invalid fields/data.
3. Exploratory analysis
4. Regression Analysis
5. Box plots
6. Histograms were used to understand where the wine qualities were concentrated. We used __ to plot our histograms with quality.
7. Independent variables are columns (physiochemical properties). dependent is quality
8.


**Exploratory Analysis:**
**Linear Regression Analysis:**

**Findings:**
The graph shows the most of the wine quality concentrates betwene 5 and 6.
High quality wine has high level of alcohol, citric acid, and sulphates; low level of density and pH.
